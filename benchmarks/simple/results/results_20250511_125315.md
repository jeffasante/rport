## Test Results

### HTTP Latency Test
Testing how quickly rport forwards HTTP requests.

| Metric | Value (ms) |
|--------|-----------|
| Minimum | 1.433 |
| Maximum | 4.473 |
| Average | 1.875 |
| Median | 1.743 |
| 95th Percentile | 3.353 |

### HTTP Throughput Test
Testing how many HTTP requests per second rport can handle.

| Concurrency | Requests/sec | Success Rate (%) |
|-------------|--------------|------------------|
| 1 | 613.29 | 100.00 |
| 5 | 1007.42 | 100.00 |
| 10 | 1040.74 | 100.00 |
| 20 | 579.66 | 100.00 |

### Memory Usage Test
Testing how much memory rport uses during operation.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| RSS (Resident Set Size) | 2.93 MB |
| VSZ (Virtual Memory Size) | 401047.82 MB |


### Summary
rport shows good performance characteristics for a port forwarding utility written in Rust:

- Low latency for HTTP request forwarding
- Good throughput even with multiple concurrent connections
- Modest memory footprint
